# Data Visualization Test

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/mcdanielj8/dataviz.git`
`npm i`

## Running on local
From the project root directory: `live-server`

## Future improvements
Due to time constraints, there are some improvements that could be made:

### Dashboard
A bar chart was chosen for this visualization, but some of the categories (such as the IDs) would really benefit from being displayed in other formats - something that could be filtered, preferably. Turning this display into a dashboard with multiple visualization options would be my first improvement.

### Code Refactoring
Some of the JS code could be refactored, especially getting new data and formatting the dates. This would help with performance.

### Styling
As always, styling can be iterated and improved upon. The dashboard UX mentioned above is one major styling point, but there could also be improvements made in other places.
